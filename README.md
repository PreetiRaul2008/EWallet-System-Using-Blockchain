Blockchain-Based E-Wallet System for a Cashless India

📘 Project Overview

India, the world’s seventh-largest economy, is rapidly transitioning toward a cashless economy. With over 1.34 billion people, the nation is witnessing massive digital growth supported by government initiatives like BHIM, PhonePe, and Google Pay.
However, despite significant progress, challenges such as financial inclusion, high transaction costs, inadequate infrastructure, and data security risks continue to slow down large-scale adoption.

To address these issues, this project introduces a Blockchain-based E-Wallet System — a secure, transparent, and efficient digital payment platform aimed at supporting India’s cashless economy initiative.

🎯 Purpose

The project leverages Blockchain Technology (BCT) — a shared, distributed ledger that ensures tamper-proof, permanent, and transparent recording of financial transactions.
It aims to enhance trust, security, and accessibility in digital payments by providing a decentralized e-wallet system that reduces reliance on traditional banking infrastructure.

This system allows users to:
-Exchange funds easily through web and mobile applications
-Maintain complete privacy and identity protection
-Experience secure, verifiable, and immutable transactions

💡 Proposed System

Our Blockchain-based E-Wallet eliminates these issues by introducing a distributed digital transaction platform where every transaction is verified and recorded securely across a decentralized network.

Key Components:
-Admin Portal: Add and manage banks and customers
-Bank Portal: Register and manage customer accounts
-Customer App: Enable secure fund transfers via blockchain
-Security Mechanisms: AES encryption and visual cryptography for enhanced privacy
-Distributed Database (WLAN): Ensures data availability and reliability

⚙️ System Objectives

-Implement a Java-based web application for digital transactions
-Integrate AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for secure data encryption
-Apply Visual Cryptography for data confidentiality
-Build Blockchain integration for decentralized transaction recording
-Develop a distributed database system using WLAN for seamless data exchange

🔒 Technological Significance
Blockchain technology is revolutionizing the financial industry by eliminating intermediaries, reducing fraud, and increasing transparency.
By integrating blockchain into India’s digital payment ecosystem, this project envisions a secure, scalable, and inclusive financial framework — paving the way for a truly cashless and transparent economy.
